In rural areas, the most preferred absorbents are reusable cloth pads and in urban areas women prefer to use commercial sanitary pads.\n1.Reusable and Washable Cloth Pads\nThey may be sustainable sanitary option but must be hygienically washed and dried in the sunlight.These cloth pads are reusable so they are cost-effective, easily available, and ecofriendly. They also need to be stored in a clean dry place for reuse to avoid contamination.\n2. Commercial Sanitary Pads\nThey are easily available at many stores, chemist shops, or online. They are expensive, compared to cloth pads and are nonreusable.\n3.Tampons\nThey are the type of absorbent that provides internal protection. They are kind of plug of soft material (cotton) which is inserted into the vagina to absorb the menstrual flow before it leaves the body. \nThere are also washable tampons made up of natural materials like bamboo, wool, cotton, or hemp. They are also knitted or crocheted using the natural absorbent material like cotton or wool. \n4.Menstrual Cups\nThey may be a new technology for poor women and girls and an alternative to sanitary pads and tampons. They are like cups made of medical grade silicone rubber which makes the cup easy to fold and get inserted into the vagina to collect menstrual blood. They can be worn up to 6–12 hours depending upon the amount of menstrual flow, so it needs to be removed and emptied less frequently. They are reusable and cost-effective.\n5.Other cheap options\nBamboo fiber pads provides infection and irritation-free menstruation. It has more absorbing capacity and is cheaper and safer to use.\nNowadays, low-cost sanitary pads for rural women made from waste banana tree fibre were sold under trade name “Saathi” in India. They are environment-friendly and decompose within six months after use. Besides these products, women in the remote rural areas also use natural materials like cow dung, leaves, and mud\n
